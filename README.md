## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains air quality measurements such as:
- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO2
- SO2
- CO
- O3
- AQI (Air Quality Index)

Each record includes a timestamp and location for contextual analysis.

## ✅ What We Did

- ✅ **Data Cleaning**  
  - Removed missing/null values  
  - Handled duplicate entries  
  - Formatted dates and standardized column names

- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Summary statistics and distribution of key pollutants  
  - Correlation matrix to detect relationships  
  - Outlier detection using statistical and visual methods

- 📉 **Visualizations**  
  - Line plots of pollutant trends over time  
  - Histograms and boxplots to analyze distributions  
  - Heatmaps to show correlations  
  - Scatter plots for feature comparisons

---

## 🧠 Insights

- Identified strong correlations between certain pollutants (e.g., PM2.5 and AQI)
- Spotted seasonal spikes in pollution levels
- Outliers often linked with specific events or locations
